# cm002 - October 4, 2018

## Overview

* Identify the importance of graphics in communicating information
* Define the layered grammar of graphics
* Demonstrate how to use layered grammar of graphics to build Minard's graph of Napoleon's invasion of Russia
* Practice generating layered graphics using [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2)

## Before class

* Read chapters 1-4 from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
    * Chapters 1, 2, and 4 are very short but set the stage for the next few weeks
    * Chapter 3 is crucial - you need to read this chapter and complete some of the exercises before coming to class. Exercise solutions can be found [here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/).
* Read [The grammar of graphics](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/dataviz_grammar_of_graphics.html)
    * If you have additional time, also read/skim [A Layered Grammar of Graphics](http://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098)
* [Install and setup software](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup00.html)

## Slides and class materials

* [Slides](extras/cm002_slides.html)
* [Why visualize data?](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/dataviz_why.html)
* [How to build a complicated, layered graphic](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/dataviz_minard.html)
* [Practice generating layered graphics using `ggplot2`](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/dataviz_gapminder.html)

* [Exploring Minard's 1812 plot with `ggplot2`](https://github.com/andrewheiss/fancy-minard) - a much fancier (and more complex) version

## Additional resources

### Graphical design

* [Tufte, Edward R. *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) Classic book on statistical graphics and visualization design.

### `ggplot2`

* [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4) -- Hadley Wickham. Excellent resource for learning the intricacies of `ggplot2`.
* [Documentation for ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/)
* Why do we learn the `ggplot2` graphics library and not the base [`graphics`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Graphics.html) system? David Robinson explains it well in [Don't teach built-in plotting to beginners (teach ggplot2)](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/), and follows up with a longer defense of `ggplot2` in [Why I use ggplot2](http://varianceexplained.org/r/why-I-use-ggplot2/)

### Useful cheatsheets

* [Data visualization with ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
* [RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf) - if you don't know what all the buttons and panels do in RStudio, this is a great decoder
