# cm004 - October 10, 2018

## Overview

* Define a tibble
* Demonstrate how vectors can be read and parsed
* Define various data file formats and functions for importation
* Define tidy data and its characteristics
* Practice tidying data

## Before class

* Read Chapters 9-12 from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* Read [Wickham, H. (2014). Tidy data. *Journal of Statistical Software*, 59(10), 1-23.](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)
    * Ignore the code examples - `plyr` and `reshape2` are no longer the dominant packages in R for reshaping and tidying data. Focus instead on the definition and types of "messy" datasets
