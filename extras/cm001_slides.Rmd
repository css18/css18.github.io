## Me (Dr. Benjamin Soltoff)

* Background
* Training/experience
* Software

## Course website

> https://css18.github.io

## Course objectives

* Construct and execute basic programs in R
* Visualize information and data
* Generate reproducible documents with [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
* Utilize professional document typesetting with mathematical notation via Markdown and $\LaTeX$
* Define key concepts related to theory of probability
* Identify and simulate random variables
* Calculate expected value and variance of random variables
* Write likelihood functions and optimizers
* Conduct hypothesis tests
* Implement Bayesian methods of inference
* Evaluate via simulations the major properties and assumptions of OLS
* Conduct inference and hypothesis testing for regression models

## What are we skipping

* Linear algebra
* Calculus
* Focus mostly on probability and statistical inference

## How we will do this

* Computational exercises
* Theory and application

## 15 minute rule

## Plagiarism

I am trying to balance two competing perspectives:

1. Collaboration is good
1. Collaboration is cheating

## Plagiarism

> If you don't understand what the program is doing and are not prepared to explain it in detail, you should not submit it.

## Evaluations

* Weekly problem sets with a combination of analytical and computational problems
* Each worth 10 points
* [Basic homework workflow](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/hw00_homework_guidelines.html#homework_workflow)

## R

* Open-source
* Collaborative
* Popular

## Benefits/drawbacks of R

* Data analysis
* Data visualization
* Speed

## Why are we not using Python?

## Benefits/drawbacks of Python

* General computation
* Speed
* Workflow
* Visualizations
* Add-on libraries

## It's not a war

## Other software

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/)
* Git/GitHub
* $\LaTeX$
* Markdown

## $\LaTeX$

* High-quality typesetting system
* De facto standard for production of technical and scientific documentation
* Renders documents as PDFs
* Makes typesetting easy

    ```latex
    $$f(x) = \frac{\exp(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} )}{ \sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}$$
    ```

    $$f(x) = \frac{\exp(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} )}{ \sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}$$

* Steep learning curve up front, but leads to big dividends later

## Markdown

* Lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax
* Easy to convert to HTML, PDF, and more
* Used commonly on GitHub documentation, Jupyter Notebooks, R Markdown, and more
* Simplified syntax compared to $\LaTeX$ - also less flexibility
* Many publishing formats
